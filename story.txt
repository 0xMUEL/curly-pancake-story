  Once upon a time, there is a Kindom called Rabbitopia, which is created by 
the young rabbit king named Carrototo. Carrototo has a beautiful daughter
named Cabbagege, and it is about the time for her to marry someone.
  One day, Cabbagege is playing in the vegetable farms, here comes a strange
guy. The strange guy has a pair of long ears, a strong body with grey thick
fur, and the most importantly, he has a pair of sharp teeth! Oh, it's must be
a wolf!
  Princess Cabbagege sees him and feels very afraid and shocked, she thinks,
"Oh my rabbit, am I supposed to die today? I am still a young cute rabbit, who
is willing to eat a little cute?"
  Then the wolf...
